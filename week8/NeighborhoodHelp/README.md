# Neighborhood Help App

In this assignment we built a mobile app with React Native (Expo, TypeScript) that demonstrates Firebase Firestore integration. In the app the user can add, view and delete requests for neighborhood help.

** Features **
Add Requests: Users can enter a title and description and submit a request.

Retrieve Requests: Requests are displayed in a list in real-time using Firestore’s onSnapshot.

Delete Requests: Users can remove requests from the list, which also deletes them from Firestore.
