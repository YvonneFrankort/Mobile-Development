# Todo List App

In this assignment we created a simple React Native Todo List application. The goal was to allow users to add tasks, mark them as done or undone by tapping the task, and delete tasks when needed. All tasks are saved locally using AsyncStorage so the list persists between app launches. The UI is divided into components, with each task rendered using a separate TaskLine component
