# Todo List App (useReducer)

In this assignment we created a simple React Native Todo List application (extension of week 4). The goal was to allow users to add tasks, mark them as done or undone by tapping the task, and delete tasks. 
All the logic for adding, toggling, and deleting tasks is handled in a custom hook (useTodo) using useReducer, so the main App component only handles the UI. The task list is stored in memory using useReducer, so tasks are not saved between app launches.
