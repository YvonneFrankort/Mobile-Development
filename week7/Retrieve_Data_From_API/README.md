# Restaurant Finder App

In this assignment we built a mobile app that retrieves data from a free open‑data API. I chose a restaurant app using OpenStreetMap. The user can type a city and a food type and the app fetches matching locations. The HomeScreen displays a list of results, showing each restaurant’s name and address.
Selecting a restaurant opens the DetailScreen, which shows the same information along with an interactive map using react-native-maps. The map is centered on the restaurant’s coordinates and includes a marker.
