# Barcode Scanner App

In this assignment we built a app that uses the camera to scan barcodes. The app requests camera permission, shows a live camera preview, and reads EAN‑8 and EAN‑13 barcodes using Expo’s CameraView. After a barcode is scanned, the result is shown on screen, and a Scan again button lets the user reset the scanner to read the next item.
